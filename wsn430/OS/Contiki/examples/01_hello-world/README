The hello-world example implements two concurrent processes.
The first is called "hello_world" and will periodically print "Hello World" and an increasing counter on the serial port.
The second is called "blink" and will blink the LEDs at a higher rate than the other process.

The print output can be observed on a PC with a serial terminal.
