To compile this software, you need mspgcc installed (http://mspgcc.sf.net), and to have the SensTools drivers and FreeRTOS port for WSN430 (http://www.senstools.info).
The following environment variables must be set:
- WSN430_DRIVERS_PATH must point to the WSN430 drivers obtained from SensTools
- FREERTOS_PATH must point to the FreeRTOS port for WSN430 obtained from SensTools

You can select the WSN430 version in the makefile, setting the VERSION_14 to 1 for version 1.4 or to 0 for version 1.3.

Then just type:
 $ make
and it should get compiled.
