Contiki-tools
=============

These tools allow you to interract with a node by creating an
IP tunnel over serial link using SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).

There are tools made for:
+ senslab platform to connect to the nodes through on your virtual machine 
+ tools done to connect to the node when it is plugged to a personnal
  computer over serial link.

The first ones are basically adaptations of the contiki tools which uses a
tcp connection to experiment handler instead of opening the /dev/ttyS0 file.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP
> "In computer networking, TUN and TAP are virtual network kernel devices.
> They are network devices that are supported entirely in software,
> which is different from ordinary network devices that are backed up by
> hardware network adapters.
>
> TAP (as in network tap) simulates an Ethernet device and it operates with
> layer 2 packets such as Ethernet frames.
> TUN (as in network TUNnel) simulates a network layer device and it operates
> with layer 3 packets such as IP packets.
>
> TAP is used to create a network bridge, while TUN is used with routing.
>
> Packets sent by an operating system via a TUN/TAP device are delivered to a
> user-space program that attaches itself to the device. A user-space program
> may also pass packets into a TUN/TAP device. In this case TUN/TAP device
> delivers (or "injects") these packets to the operating system network stack
> thus emulating their reception from an external source." 




Senslab adapted tools
---------------------

### Usage

#### Serial Link

As these tools are using the node serial link by connecting to experiment:30000+node_id, 
you need to quit all the connections to the node serial link like the netcats,
listener to all nodes, disable the connection to this node in automation tools.


#### Execution right

The tools must be run as root


### TUN

The senslip and senslip6 are used to dialog with a node implementing a server listenig on a SLIP ip stack.

+ senslip  <=> tunslip  using nc experiment 30000 + node_id instead of /dev/ttyUSB
+ senslip6 <=> tunslip6 using nc experiment 30000 + node_id instead of /dev/ttyUSB


### TAP

The tap6-start.sh script must be used with the uip6-bridge firwmare.

It allows to listen and send packets on the Radio interface at OSI Layer 2: data link layer.
For the OS, it is as if the tap0 interface created was the radio interface of the senslab node.

+ tap6-start.sh <=> tapslip6 using nc experiment 30000 + node_id instead of /dev/ttyUSB



### Node Firmware

uip6-bridge forward packets directly from the serial link to the radio chip and vice-versa.
It must be used with the tap6-start.sh script
