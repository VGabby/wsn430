This application will act as a 6LoWPAN network interface for your computer. It will *not* be a node of the network that you'll be able to ping or do anything, it will just convert ethernet+IPv6 frames to 802.15.5+6LoWPAN frames.

You'll be able to interact with other nodes programmed with the uIPv6 stack and 6LoWPAN.

Compile the bridge application (make) and load it on a node. Connect it to a serial port of your computer, say /dev/ttyS0.

Your computer needs to run the radvd program (IPv6 router advertisement daemon), so install the radvd package: (with fedora core10, as root)
 # yum install radvd

This software need then to be configured. Edit the /etd/radvd.conf file as follows:
# /etc/radvd.conf BEGIN
interface tap0 {
      AdvSendAdvert on;
      AdvLinkMTU 1280;
      AdvCurHopLimit 128;
          AdvReachableTime 360000;
          MinRtrAdvInterval 100;
          MaxRtrAdvInterval 150;
          AdvDefaultLifetime 200;
	  # here you may put the prefix you want
          prefix 2001:0123:4567:89ab::/64
      {
               AdvOnLink on;
           AdvAutonomous on;
           AdvPreferredLifetime 4294967295;
           AdvValidLifetime 4294967295;
      };
};
# /etc/radvd.conf END

Before launching the daemon, you need to enable IPv6 forwarding on your machine:
# sysctl -x net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

You now have to set up the new network interface. In the Contiki/tools folder, type 'make' to build the tapslip6 program that'll do it, and then launch it (as root):
# ./tapslip6 -t tap0 -s ttyS0 127.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
You can also use the bash script tapslip6.sh, that contains this line.


Launch the daemon:
# /etc/init.d/radvd start

The tap0 interface has obtained a link-local IPv6 address from the bridge node, you can observe that if you run 'ifconfig tap0'. It should look like:
inet6 addr: fe80::212:91ff:fec7:1b01/64 Scope:Link

You finally need to set up a global address for this interface, using the same prefix as the one from the radvd.conf file, for example:
# ifconfig tap0 add 2001:0123:4567:89ab::1/64

That's it! Now when a node will ask for a router, the PC will respond using this prefix and the node will get this address added to its link local one.
You are now able to ping6 the running nodes, provided you know their IP addresses, and interact with them depending on the application they embedd.
