Simple echo server replying what's received on a UDP port.

It creates a UDP 'connection', listening on port 50000, waiting for an incoming packet.
When it's received, it sends back the same data prefixed by "rx=".

You can test the application using netcat:
$ nc -u 172.16.xxx.xxx 50000
Where 172.16.xxx.xxx should be replaced by the node IP address.
