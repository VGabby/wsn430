he echo example implements a simple protosocket example.
It creates a listening socket on port 12345, asks for data when connected, and replies back the data when received. Finally it closes the connection.
To try it, execute the following in a terminal: $ nc 172.16.1.xxx 12345
Note that tunslip (found in Contiki/tools) must be running in order to provide IP connectivity.
