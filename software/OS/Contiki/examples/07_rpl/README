This example features two applications: "border router" and "udp", that are 
used to demonstrate the use of IPv6 and RPL.

The first found in the rpl-border-router folder will provide the RPL DAG root 
and should be connected to a PC. It also embeds a webserver showing the list of
connected devices and routes.
The second provide a UDP server establishing a DAG (being as well the root) and 
a UDP client that will join the RPL DAG and be able to communicate with the 
border router or UDP server.

This is how to run the demo:
1) compile the border router application
 $ cd rpl-border-router
 $ make
    [...]

2) flash the border-router.wsn430 firmware to a node, and connect it to e.g. 
ttyS0

3) go to the tools folder of the Contiki directory, and run the tunslip6 script
with root priviledges

 # ./tunslip6 -a experiment -p 30000+<NODE_ID> aaaa::1/64

(look at the node address, as written in the terminal)


 4) in another terminal, go to the rpl-udp folder, and compile the application:
 $ cd rpl-udp
 $ make
   [...]
5) flash a node with the udp-client.wsn430 firmware

6) in a web browser, indicate the IPv6 address of the border router node, e.g.:
http://[aaaa::4a00:12:91b9:9e01]/

7) you should see the list of the connected node, and you should be able to ping
them with the ping6 command!
