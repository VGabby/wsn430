Here you can find the files needed to compile applications using TinyOS for the WSN430v13b platform. You need the TinyOS tools installed (nesc compiler, tinyos-tools ...), and you must set up the following environment variables:
TOSDIR: points to this TinyOS folder, containing 'apps', support' and 'tos'
TOSROOT: points to TOSDIR/tos
CLASSPATH: points to TOSDIR/"support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar:."


Then you can compile applications using the following command:
 make wsn430v13

Examples applications are found in 'apps'.

The whole TinyOS source is based from TinyOS Release 2.1
