This is the Senslab port of the TinyOS release version 2.1.1
It supports the two Senslab nodes: the wsn430v13 (with CC1100 radio chip) and the wsn430v14 (with CC2420 radio chip).

In order to use TinyOS for Senslab, and install the toolchain in your dedicated virtual machine, follow the following steps:
1) Become root
$ sudo su -

2) Add the tinyos repository
# echo "deb http://hinrg.cs.jhu.edu/tinyos lenny main"  >> /etc/apt/sources.list

3) Update and install the tinyos packages, for msp430 and version 2.1.1
# apt-get update
# apt-get install tinyos-required-msp430 tinyos-2.1.1

4) Place the extracted files in /opt/tinyos-2.1.1 (the support/make/*.target and tos/platform/wsn430* files and folders)

5) Update your .bashrc, add the tinyos.sh file in it
$ echo "source /opt/tinyos-2.1.1/tinyos.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

6) That's it, copy the apps folder to your home dir, and start working
$ cp  -r /opt/tinyos-2.1.1/apps ~/tinyos-apps
$ cd ~/tinyos-apps/Blink
$ make wsn430v13
