In order to use TinyOS with the WSN430v13 motesn you must first install TinyOS, as explained on its website. (www.tinyos.net)
This being done, you should have a folder 'tinyos-2.x' in your /opt/ folder containing the tinyos source files. If you installed tinyos somewhere else, do the maths to apply what follows.

Move the provided tinyos-2.x-contrib folder beside the tinyos-2.x one, thus in /opt/

Export the following environment variables, for example by putting this in your .bashrc file:

export TOSROOT=/opt/tinyos-2.x
export TOSDIR=$TOSROOT/tos
export CLASSPATH=$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar:.
export MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
export TOSMAKE_PATH=${TOSROOT}/../tinyos-2.x-contrib/senstools/support/make

You can now compile examples by going in the Blink example of the apps folder:
  $ cd $(TOSROOT)/apps/Blink

Compile it and program a node, if a JTAG probe is plugged in it:
  $ make wsn430v13 install jtag

That's it!

The whole TinyOS source is based from TinyOS Release 2.1
