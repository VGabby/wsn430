This folder contains six application examples for WSN430 using FreeRTOS.
Refer to http://senstools.gforge.inria.fr for mode information.

In order to compile these examples, you should set two environment variables:
- FREERTOS_PATH should point to the FreeRTOS folder (containing the Source and Demo folders)
- WSN430_DRIVERS_PATH should point to the WSN430 drivers folder (archive available on the senstools website)

Then open a terminal in each example folder and run 'make'
