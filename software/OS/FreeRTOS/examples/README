This folder contains application examples for WSN430 using FreeRTOS.
Refer to http://www.senslab.info for mode information.

In order to compile these examples, you should set two environment variables:
- FREERTOS_PATH should point to the FreeRTOS folder (containing the Source, lib, kernel and examples folders) (it should be parent folder)
- WSN430_DRIVERS_PATH should point to the WSN430 drivers folder
- WSN430_LIB_PATH should point to the WSN430 OS free library folder (containing phy and mac folders)

(archives available on the senslab.info website)

Then open a terminal in each example folder and run 'make'
