TDMA OS-Free Implementation (cc1100 only)


The TDMA defines the network as one coordinator node, and several end nodes. Time is divided in slots, managed by the coordinator.
Slots may be allocated to the nodes by the coordinator, thus they will use this defined time duration to send packets to the coordinator.

This type of network is useful to handle a large number of nodes (>10) while offering an interesting throughput from the nodes to the coordinator.
