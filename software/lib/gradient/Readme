This wireless network application is divided in three parts :
     * The sink which sends periodical beacon and collect data from the network
     * The anchors which are relaying data 
     * The mobile nodes, which are collecting data (or whatever you want) and sending them for the sink

To run your application you should :
     * Change the hello_t structure in gradient.h to add your data
     * Add the behaviour of the mobile node in the function uint16_t send_packet() in the file mobile.c
     * Add the behaviour of the sink in the function void process_report(report_t * report) in the file sink.c

You should not have to modify the anchors, they are only relaying data.
