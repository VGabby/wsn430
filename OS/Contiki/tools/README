Contiki-tools
=============

These tools allow you to interract with a node by creating an
IP tunnel over serial link using SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol).

There are the original contiki tools and adapted version to allow usage on the
virtual machine and connection to 'experiment' server instead of using a
/dev/ttySO file for the serial link.

When there ise a senslab specific version, it's name is prefixed by 'sen'.


Usage
=====

The tools must be run as root


Serial Link connection
----------------------

The tools use the node serial link, by connecting to experiment:30000+node_id.
So you need to quit all the connections to the node like the netcats, listener
to all nodes, maybe an automation tool.


Tools
=====

TUN
---

tunslip/senslip and tunslip6 are used with a 'border-router' application.
The virtual machine will be the "default" route for the sensor network.

TAP
---

tapslip6/sentapslip6 and the 'tap6-start.sh' are used with the 'uip6-bridge'
application, when radio networking traffic sniffing/injection is wanted.

It allows to listen and send packets on the Radio interface at OSI Layer 2: data link layer.
For the OS, it is as if the tap0 interface created was the radio interface of the senslab node.
