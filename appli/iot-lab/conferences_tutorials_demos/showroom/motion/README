This example illustrates motion capture and wireless communication, with on-PC data processing.

We're going to monitor a human leg with 2 accelerometers (one on the thigh, the other on the tibia), and optionally an FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor) board with the sensors in a shoe insert.

Hardware required:
	- 1 WSN430 for the sink
	- 2 WSN430 with motion capture daughter boards
	- 1 WSN430 fir AmpOp daughter board, and a shoe insert with FSR in it (optional)

Compile the application named "sensor_accel", and flash the 2 WSN430 nodes with the motion capture borads with it.
Optionally compile the "sensor_fsr" application, and flash the WSN430 with the corresponding daughter board with it.

Compile and flash the sink node with the "sink" application.

Plug the Sink Node to a Serial port of your computer and power it up.
run the articulated_leg.py python program (it requires the visual python module).
Power up an accelerometer node, an place it on the thigh.
Power up the other accelerometer and place it on the tibia.
Optionnally power the shoe insert node up.

You should now see the 3D leg move, and the background ov the window change when you move the leg and press the shoe insert, respectively.
